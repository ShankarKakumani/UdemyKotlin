    <string name="str_terms_text">What’s covered in these terms We know it’s tempting to skip these
        Terms of Service, but it’s important to establish what you can expect from us as you use
        Google services, and what we expect from you.  These Terms of Service reflect the way
        Google’s business works, the laws that apply to our company, and certain things we’ve always
        believed to be true. As a result, these Terms of Service help define Google’s relationship
        with you as you interact with our services. For example, these terms include the following
        topic headings:      What you can expect from us, which describes how we provide and
        develop our services     What we expect from you, which establishes certain rules for
        using our services     Content in Google services, which describes the intellectual
        property rights to the content you find in our services — whether that content belongs
        to you, Google, or others     In case of problems or disagreements, which describes other
        legal rights you have, and what to expect in case someone violates these terms
        Understanding these terms is important because, by using our services, you’re agreeing to
        these terms.  Besides these terms, we also publish a Privacy Policy. Although it’s not part
        of these terms, we encourage you to read it to better understand how you can update, manage,
        export, and delete your information.

    <string name="mars_text_description">Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System after Mercury. In English, Mars carries a name of the Roman god of war, and is often referred to as the \"Red Planet\"[15][16] because the reddish iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance that is distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye.[17] Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth. The rotational period and seasonal cycles of Mars are likewise similar to those of Earth, as is the tilt that produces the seasons. Mars is the site of Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and second-highest known mountain in the Solar System, and of Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar System. The smooth Borealis basin in the northern hemisphere covers 40% of the planet and may be a giant impact feature.[18][19] Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are small and irregularly shaped. These may be captured asteroids,[20][21] similar to 5261 Eureka, a Mars trojan. </string>
