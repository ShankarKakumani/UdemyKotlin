    <string name="str_terms_text">What’s covered in these terms We know it’s tempting to skip these
        Terms of Service, but it’s important to establish what you can expect from us as you use
        Google services, and what we expect from you.  These Terms of Service reflect the way
        Google’s business works, the laws that apply to our company, and certain things we’ve always
        believed to be true. As a result, these Terms of Service help define Google’s relationship
        with you as you interact with our services. For example, these terms include the following
        topic headings:      What you can expect from us, which describes how we provide and
        develop our services     What we expect from you, which establishes certain rules for
        using our services     Content in Google services, which describes the intellectual
        property rights to the content you find in our services — whether that content belongs
        to you, Google, or others     In case of problems or disagreements, which describes other
        legal rights you have, and what to expect in case someone violates these terms
        Understanding these terms is important because, by using our services, you’re agreeing to
        these terms.  Besides these terms, we also publish a Privacy Policy. Although it’s not part
        of these terms, we encourage you to read it to better understand how you can update, manage,
        export, and delete your information.

        Google LLC

        Age requirements

        If you’re under the age required to manage your own Google Account, you must have your parent or legal guardian’s permission to use a Google Account. Please have your parent or legal guardian read these terms with you.

        If you’re a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your child to use the services, then these terms apply to you and you’re responsible for your child’s activity on the services.
